# top-twitch-streamers

This repository is part of my *Data Analysis with Python* project for NYC Data Science Academy. 

The goal of the project was to find a dataset available online, conduct exploratory data analyses using Python, and draw some meaningful insights. 
I decided to look into the factors that make a twitch streamer successful and what variables might promote the growth of a channel.
As may have been expected, maximizing watch time, viewers, and followers are all positively correlated with increased earnings and faster channel growth. 
Interestingly, increased streaming time was not associated with higher earnings or channel growth, suggesting that the quality of the content is more important than quantity.  

## Data Sources

This project uses data from two sources. 
The first is the [Top Streamers on Twitch](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aayushmishra1512/twitchdata/data) dataset from Kaggle, with information on the top 1000 Twitch streamers from around 2020.

The second data source comes from the [Twitch Earnings Leaderboard](https://twitch.pages.dev), showing the earnings of top Twitch streamers from August 2019 until October 2021.
